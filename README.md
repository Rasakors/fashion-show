# fashion-show documentation / write up

Project Name

	For the project name, I kept it as simple as possible, as I wanted the header and title to look the same, and be very minimalistic. Although at first, I wanted the title to be simply “Fashion Show”, I decided that it had to be more specific.

Project Description 
What is the project? 
What is the overall concept and theme? 
What kind of experience you were striving to create?

	My project is a website coded with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
It houses the video that our group - me, Douglas, and Khalifa, created. The video features the best NYUAD outfits we could find close to our class building, the Arts Center. 
	The main project, however, is the “home” of our video is a website that I have been creating since the video was made. My first ideas can be seen in the wireframe, and more or less - I have stuck to the wireframe because of its clean look. In the beginning, I thought that the website could/would only be one page, but I hoped that I could do more. I’m happy to say that now it consists of 3 pages - the homepage (index.html), the “about me” (about.html) page that is also embedded into the homepage, as well as a page that has the contact form to “contact me” (contact.html). 
	From the beginning, I strived to achieve an aesthetic look with the colors that I like. Pink popped up in my head as related to fashion, and so I went with colors, that include different shades of pink, shades of brown, grey, white, and black. I wanted the colors to reflect some of the colors in the video, but that would not go too overboard. I believe that the less - the better. I made the color allocation of the other two pages besides the homepage slightly different, as I wanted the main page to stand out. 
	I expected the website to appear simple, minimalistic, and well-rounded. Something that would make sense for the fashion video - that the video would shine with the fashion parts within it, and there would not be too much text. I wanted the website to appear comfortable to the eye, and easy to navigate and understand, while also including some interesting aspects such as an embedded page and a map. I wanted it to be experimental, but, still, sticking to the rules I had made up. 

Process 
How did you go about implementing the concept?

	I started by watching a lot of videos that were on our class slides and following other coders within the videos to get more comfortable with my own code. I have had some experience with making websites, but quite minimal. I understood that it was important to go over a lot of the basics, as otherwise, I could not implement some of the harder things if I did not learn to be comfortable with the most “simple” parts. 
	As I went on and followed videos, I also started googling how to do other things that were not mentioned in the videos. I had the basic outline of the three pages, but I had to arrange the content and find carousels, for example. Some of the parts such as the contact page and carousels, I took and adapted for my page from coding websites, but of course, I credited those parts. If I wanted something that I had on my wireframe or imagined in my mind - I searched it up. I found that it was possible to find so many code examples and that I did not have to struggle with all the things creating them from scratch, which also meant that I could adjust the concept and theme to what I wanted them to be. 
	I followed this approximate order in creating the website: brainstorm, wireframe, pick colors, basic layout, content, added layout pieces, the adaptation of the added pieces to the basic color scheme and layout, add comments/pictures to the carousel, add the video thumbnail to suit the website nd B&W filter to the map, last adjustments of size and pixels of the layout pieces that make up the webpages.

Reflection/Evaluation:
This should bookend the initial concept and talk about whether your expectations and goals were met in the process of building the final working version.

It is important to mention that I went through some struggles with my code. When I first chose the carousel, it was not showing up from the code provided. I had to move around the sections, div’s until it showed up. The one thing I did not manage to fix, even after trying myself for a few hours and asking for help, is for the first carousel picture to appear itself. However, I left it as it is because I got comfortable with the look and I believe that it suits the website as it is. I also could not make the video appear in a way that would suit the website at first, so I spent a lot of time re-uploading that to YouTube in different formats, and I got it to work in the end.
	Overall, I am very pleased with what came out of my website. I believe that I managed to stick to most of my expectations and the wireframe, but I did make some adjustments, which I am also happy about. Because when it comes to creating the website with content, some things can appear “too much” when implemented – adding pictures of my teammates or adding a carousel right next to the video would have been overstimulating. I believe that it was important to stay flexible with my expectations, as not everything can always work out as one first ideates. I believe that the overall concept turned out to be even better than I expected. I am happy that the code works, of course, but I am even happier about little adjustments such as color-coordinating – choosing a special Instagram icon, B&W map, and drawing a thumbnail for the video.
